      <p><strong>Who started this movement?</strong></p>
      <p>James Nicholas Gilman started this movement.  You may find more information about James from reading <a href="http://flcd-3.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">his blog</a>, which he started when he attempted to run for office in 2010.  You will mostly learn <a href="http://www.flcd-3.blogspot.com/2010/06/get-involved-it-is-only-way-to-protect.html" target="_blank">how he thinks</a> and a little bit <a href="http://flcd-3.blogspot.com/2014/08/its-hard-to-participate-i-know-all-to_8.html" target="_blank">about him and his family</a> from his posts over the past seven years. </p>
      <p><strong>This idea sounds crazy, <i>bats#!^ crazy</i>. How likely is it to succeed?</strong></p>
      <p>Crazy? Maybe. We think <i><strong>the following is crazier:</strong></i> --that in 215 years we have gone from electing Thomas Jefferson as President to potentially nominating candidates for the major two political parties that arguably care more about something other than promoting the principles expoused by the Founding Fathers.</p>
      <p>Chance of success is currently extremely low. For this movement to succeed we need the participation from people such as you, your family, your neighbors and your friends. America needs you to be involved.</p>
      <p><strong>I vote. My friends and family vote. Is that not enough participation?</strong></p>
      <p>No. Well funded interests participate daily.  When have you gone door-to-door or made phone calls on behalf of a candidate?  When have you signed a petition to help a citizen place their name on a ballot, even if that citizen was not of the party you liked? Have you written to your elected officals? Do you know most if not all your elected officials?</p>
      <p><strong>How does this plan work?</strong></p>
      <p>We begin with the end in mind, which necessitates all of us writing-in the same name on our respective ballots on Tuesday November 8, 2016. The process to reach this end will be analagous to herding cats.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of work required in an extremely short period of time such as: getting the word out, performing research, conductiong surveys, determining a selection criteria, narrowing the list, sending at least weekly emails, and the list goes on.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Please note, we do not ask for your money.  We ask for something more valuable.  We ask for you...your blood, your sweat, your tears and your desire to help ensure all Americans can pursue life, liberty and happinesess. Would you like to help?</strong></em></p>
