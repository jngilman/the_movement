      <p><strong>Who started this movement?</strong></p>
      <p>James Nicholas Gilman started this movement.  You may find more information reading <a href="http://flcd-3.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">his blog</a>, which he started when he attempted to run for office in 2010.  You will mostly learn <a href="http://www.flcd-3.blogspot.com/2010/06/get-involved-it-is-only-way-to-protect.html" target="_blank">how he thinks</a> and a little bit <a href="http://flcd-3.blogspot.com/2014/08/its-hard-to-participate-i-know-all-to_8.html" target="_blank">about him and his family</a> from his posts over the past seven years. </p>
      <p><strong>This idea sounds crazy. How likely is it to succeed?</strong></p>
      <p>Crazy? Maybe. We think the following is crazier: --that in 215 years we have gone from electing Thomas Jefferson as President to potentially nominating and electing candidates that arguably care more about power than promoting the principles expoused by the Founding Fathers and who have demonstrated little problem solving skills, argumentative reasoning and sound economic concepts.</p>
      <p>This movement cannot succeed without the participation from people such as you, your family, your neighbors and friends.</p>
      <p><strong>How does this plan work?</strong></p>
      <p>Working together we will derive a process to determine the best candidate for the United States, which we then <i>write-in</i> there name on our respective ballots on November 8, 2016. The process will include things such as: getting the word out, performing research, conductiong surveys, determining a selection criteria, narrowing the list, sending weekly emails, the list goes on.</p>
