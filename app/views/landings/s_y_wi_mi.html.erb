      <p><strong>Who started this movement?</strong></p>
      <p>James Nicholas Gilman started this movement.  You may find more from information reading <a href="http://flcd-3.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">his blog</a>, which he started when he attempted to run for office in 2010.  You will mostly learn <a href="http://www.flcd-3.blogspot.com/2010/06/get-involved-it-is-only-way-to-protect.html" target="_blank">how he thinks</a> and a little bit <a href="http://flcd-3.blogspot.com/2014/08/its-hard-to-participate-i-know-all-to_8.html" target="_blank">about him and his family</a> from his posts over the past seven years. </p>
      <p><strong>This idea sounds crazy. How likely is it to succeed?</strong></p>
      <p>Crazy? Maybe. We think the following is crazier: --that in 215 years we have gone from electing Thomas Jefferson as President to potentially nominating and electing candidates that arguably care more about power than promoting the principles expoused by the Founding Fathers and who have demonstrated a lack of problem solving skills leveraging argumentative reasoning and sound economic concepts.</p>
      <p>This movement cannot succeed without the participation from people such as you, your family, your neighbors and your friends. America needs you to be involved.</p>
      <p><strong>I vote. My friends vote. Is that enough?</strong></p>
      <p>We regret to inform you, but our government needs more than your vote.  When have you gone door-to-door or made phone calls on behalf of a candidate?  When have you signed a petition to help a citizen place their name a ballot even if that citizen was not of the party you liked? Have you written to your elected officals? Do you know all your elected officials?  Sadly, we do not participate, which creates a void that is filled by well funded interests that has arguably led to the polarization in government.</p>
      <p><strong>How does this plan work?</strong></p>
      <p>Working together we will derive a process to determine the best candidate for the United States, which we then <i>write-in</i> their name on our respective ballots on November 8, 2016. It is very well possible we create a new means by which we elect out leaders.  A means that is data driven and based on logic not emotion. The process will include things such as: getting the word out, performing research, conductiong surveys, determining a selection criteria, narrowing the list, sending weekly emails, the list goes on.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Please note, we have not asked for your money.  We have asked for something more valuable.  We ask for you. Would you like to help?</strong></em></p>
